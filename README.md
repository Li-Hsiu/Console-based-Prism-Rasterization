This C++ program asks for inputs of a prism's dimension and center as well as the camera's coordinate in 3D and displays the prism in the console. It uses a basic incremental rasterization algorithm on a low resolution screen (100x100).

The above example uses a dimension of 4x4x4 with default center coordinate and a camera at (3,4,5). Feel free to try out different inputs although some results in terrible displays.
